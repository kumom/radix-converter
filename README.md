# Radix Converter

This small tool is built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) and [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/). It converts numbers (integers and fractions) between radix 2 to 36. Intuitively we have "a" mapped to decimal "10", "b" mapped to decimal "11", and all the way down "z" mapped to decimal "35".

_[JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi) is used to ensure cross browser compatibility._

- `npm run start` starts the development server.
- `npm run build` creates a production build.
